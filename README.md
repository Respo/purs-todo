## TODO with PureScript

> experimental project using PureScript web app togather with Webpack.

There was examples in `purs-loader` but seems not updated for long. So in this project I just trying simple web app using spago compiled js file inside `output/`.

This project is supposed to be a comparison with Respo.
Respo is built with a dynamic language featured persistent data structure.
PureScript restricts immutable data with ADT and is far more constrained.
Probably I may see how many purely FP rules I have broke in Respo.
